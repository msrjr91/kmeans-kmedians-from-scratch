# kmeans-kmedians-from-scratch
This project was a part of an unsupervised learning coursework implementing the kmeans and kmedians algorithms from scratch w/o libraries.
The goal is to compare the performances of kmeans and kmedians both normalized using L2 vector norm and unnormalized raw data.
This project uses kmeans++ to initialize centroids.
All datasets are provided.
